# SecretNumber: Test Your Wits!
Hey! Welcome to *SecretNumber*, a classic "Guess the Number" game crafted with Python. It's a fun, little command-line game designed to give your brain a quick, enjoyable workout.

## What's the Game About?
At its heart, SecretNumber is all about trying to crack a code – well, a secret number, anyway! The game picks a random number, and your job is to guess it within a limited number of tries. Don't worry, I'll give you hints along the way to guide you closer!

## What It Does:
* *Pick Your Challenge:* Whether you're new to guessing games or a seasoned pro, you can choose between *Easy (10 attempts)* or *Hard (5 attempts)*.
* *Friendly Hints:* After each guess, I'll let you know if you're too high or too low, helping you narrow down that elusive secret number.
* *Clear Outcomes:* You'll know right away if you've nailed the number or if the secret remained... well, secret!

## Ready to Play? Here's How:
1.  Kick things off by running the game script. It'll ask if you're up for a challenge – just type YES.
2.  Pop in your name so I know who I'm playing with!
3.  Take a quick glance at the rules; they're pretty straightforward.
4.  Type GO when you're all set to dive in.
5.  Choose your preferred difficulty: 1 for a more relaxed *Easy* game, or 2 for a tougher *Hard* round.
6.  And then, let the guessing begin! I'll guide you after each attempt.
7.  The goal? Find that secret number before your attempts run dry!

## Built With:
* Pure Python 3.12!
